# Dakaro Mueller's TODO Application
This application was made by Dakaro Mueller using the FERN stack for an interview assignment.

The FERN stack is as follows:
F - Firebase
E - Express
R - React
N - Node.js

The subfolder contains the react application and the main repository contains the node.js backend.
As I learn how to use react and these technologies together I expect to change the structure of the folders.

# How to use this application
1. To start the Node.js server, run `npm start` while inside the root project directory.
2. To start the React website (Still very much WIP), open another terminal and navigate to the react subfolder and run `npm start`.

The terminal messages should be different from each other, you can read the additional automatically generated readme from create-react-app script in the react subfolder.
